So this is just an ASCII calculator I made while fucking around. 
It calculates both for strings and chars, u decide. Spaces don't work with it. 
String ascii C++ Cplus C plus plus. String to ascii, char to ascii. CPP. If you want an easy access exe to check the ASCII digit of shit this is for you. Or if you want to cheat on your homework.
